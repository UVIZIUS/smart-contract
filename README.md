yf12 uses yields generated from farming other protocols. When you stake your assets through yf12â€™s DeMF (Decentralized Mutual Fund) platform, in addition to farming yf12 the assets will be used to farm the highest performing assets from other protocols.

Other solutions recalculate the best performing assets once a day. This can be prone to market manipulation and a wider yield disparity by the time the funds actually move into place.
